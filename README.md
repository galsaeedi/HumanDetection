# HumanDetection

## Introduction
I've worked on the problem of human detection,face detection, eye detection. This model is capable of detecting a human and him body parts in an image Uinsg TensorFlow's Object Detection API. 

## Requirements
<ul>
<li>Python3</li>
<li>Tensorflow 1.15: Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models</li>
<li>Opencv [v3]</li>
<li>python libraries: Here is a list of all the python dependencies
  <ul><li>numpy</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  </ul>
  </ll>

* **note:** This code runs on the cloud. If you work locally, it is recommended to install Anaconda, CUDA and cuDNN. [Here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations) is a table showing which version of TensorFlow requires which versions of CUDA and cuDNN.
