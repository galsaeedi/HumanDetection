# HumanDetection

## Introduction
I've worked on the problem of human detection,face detection, eye detection. This model is capable of detecting a human and him body parts in an image Uinsg TensorFlow's Object Detection API. 

## Requirements
<ul>
<li><b>Python3</b></li>
<li><b>Tensorflow 1.15</b>: Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models</li>
<li><b>pre-trained classifiers</b>: TensorFlow provides several object detection models (pre-trained classifiers with specific neural network architectures) in its <a herf="https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md">model zoo</a>. I re-trained my detector on the Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2 model, the detection worked very well, but with a noticeably slow speed. </li>
<li><b>Opencv</b> [v3]</li>
<li><b>python libraries</b>: Here is a list of all the python dependencies
  <ul><li>numpy</li>
  <li>numpy</li>

<b>note:</b> This code runs on the cloud. If you work locally, it is recommended to install Anaconda, CUDA and cuDNN. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations"> Here </a> is a table showing which version of TensorFlow requires which versions of CUDA and cuDNN.
